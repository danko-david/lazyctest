LazyCTest (LCT) accepts a shared object compiled with LCT library.

(When valgrind requested, before opening the shared library, LCT `execve`
	itself to run with valgrind)
	

Opens the Shared Object and looks for the LTC_TESTABLE_SHARED_OBJECT.

Collects all function symbols start with "test_" in the shared object.

To execute test in safe environment:
	- opens a shared mmap region
	- fork
	- some safety and notification ordination:
		- close unrelated mmaps ()
		- set a bit on mmapto notify on a possible crash, that the fork'd
			process is going to start the test.
	- run collected test
	- on failure: write stack trace and message into the shm region
	- before do exit, set the flag on an shm region to register normal process
		termination 

	- write test results in a standard format.

	- exit with a specifix exit status
